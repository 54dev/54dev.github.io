## About 

### What is 54dev?

54dev is the leading provider of templates for Magento from its initial release in 2008. Currently we offer more than 60 unique premium and free templates. All our themes are coded according to Magento guidelines, based on improved HTML structure and build with SEO in mind. Every Magento page was optimised in order to fix major Magento SEO issues.

Our templates are always thoroughly tested for functionality and compatibility with all of the popular browsers, as well as in the most recent Magento version. In addition, we always offer free installation, free updates and the absolute best customer support guaranteed.

If you just want to try our products then you can check our Free Magento templates and select one that will better fit your store. All our Magento extensions are also fully compatible with our themes. So if you already have our theme installed then you should not be afraid of using our Magento extension. If you are still unsure then simply contact our support team and we will be glad to find the right solution for you.
